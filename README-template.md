### What I learned + Useful resources

- [Hover](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.php) - Learned how to change the color of a text when the pointer hovers on it. 
- [Image beside text](https://www.shecodes.io/athena/37856-how-to-move-text-to-the-right-side-of-an-image-with-css#:~:text=In%20this%20example%2C%20float%3A%20left,right%20side%20of%20the%20image) - Learned how to place the text beside the image for the author section. 
- [QR Component feedback on frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/qr-code-component-with-css-5PakVqgsg3) - Used a grid to center all elements and attempted to start with mobile-first workflow. I am still not entirely sure if I did it correctly, how exactly should it be done, or if it is easier than starting with the desktop version. 
- Declared the font globally from within the assets folder, part of this was also mentioned as feedback in the resource above.
